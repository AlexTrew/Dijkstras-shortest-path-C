# Dijkstras-shortest-path-C
Practice program for finding the shortest path through a weighted graph


For the first line of input, enter edges in the following format "\[start_node,end_node,weight\]" spearated by spaces.
For the second line enter the node from which the traversal will start, and the destination node, and the max allowed distance in the following 
format \[start_nodes->destination_node,max_distance\]
